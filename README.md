Optimal Binary Search Trees (Optimal BSTs) are binary search tree data structures that optimises search queries. 
There are some items that are more likely to be searched than others. The Optimal BST minimizes the number of comparisons to find the item.
It does this by assigning a probability that represents the likelihood of the user searching for the item to each node 
and arranging itself such that the most searched items are at the top of the binary search tree.

The main project files in contained in the folder named "OptimalBST_WithGUI".
